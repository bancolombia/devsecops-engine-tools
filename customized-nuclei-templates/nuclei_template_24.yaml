  author: devsecops
  severity: low
  description: |
    Checks whether cookies in the HTTP response contain the HttpOnly attribute. If the HttpOnly flag is set, it means that the cookie is HTTP-only

  remediation: |
    Ensure that all cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute to prevent client-side access.
